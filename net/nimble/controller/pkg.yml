    # Sleep clock accuracy (sca). This is the amount of drift in the system
    # during when the device is sleeping (in parts per million).
    #
    # NOTE: 'the' master sca is an enumerated value based on the sca. Rather
    # than have a piece of code calculate this value, the developer must set
    # this value based on the value of the SCA using the following table:
    #
    #  SCA between 251 and 500 ppm (inclusive); master sca = 0
    #  SCA between 151 and 250 ppm (inclusive); master sca = 1
    #  SCA between 101 and 150 ppm (inclusive); master sca = 2
    #  SCA between 76 and 100 ppm (inclusive); master sca = 3
    #  SCA between 51 and 75 ppm (inclusive); master sca = 4
    #  SCA between 31 and 50 ppm (inclusive); master sca = 5
    #  SCA between 21 and 30 ppm (inclusive); master sca = 6
    #  SCA between 0 and 20 ppm (inclusive); master sca = 7
    #
    #  For example:
    #      if your clock drift is 101 ppm, your master should be set to 2.
    #      if your clock drift is 20, your master sca should be set to 7.
